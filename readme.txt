This is the source code for my game Cyberdogs, written ca 1994.
This source is released into the public domain.

Note: I still retain copyright for the game and the graphics.
You may use the source as you wish, but not the graphics or the game itself.

The source is written for Borland Pascal 7.0 and makes use of two third-party libraries:

SPX (2.0 or 3.0, can't recall) graphics library by Scott Ramsay.

DSMI soundlibrary by Otto Chrons and Jussi Lahdenniemi (I probably spelled that wrong).

Neither of these are included. 
They are not mine to give away and I no longer have copies of them anyway.

I will not give any support for this source. You're on your own.
